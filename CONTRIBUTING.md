## Description:
Welcome to our project's contribution guidelines! This comprehensive guide outlines our development practices, 
code organization, and workflow processes. Following these guidelines ensures:
- Consistent code quality across the project
- Efficient collaboration between team members
- Clear tracking of changes and features
- Maintainable and scalable codebase
- Streamlined review and deployment processes

## Project Structure:
Our project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Directories:
- `backend/`: Server-side implementation
  - API endpoints and business logic
  - Service integrations
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Performance monitoring
  - Requires backend team approval for changes

- `frontend/`: Client-side implementation
  - User interface components
  - State management
  - API integrations
  - Asset management
  - Requires frontend team approval for changes

- `database/`: Data layer management
  - Schema definitions
  - Migration scripts
  - Query optimizations
  - Data models
  - Requires database team approval for changes

- `ux-ui/`: Design system
  - Design tokens
  - Component specifications
  - Style guides
  - Asset libraries
  - Requires UX/UI team approval for changes

### Additional Directories:
- `docs/`: Project documentation
- `tests/`: Test suites and fixtures
- `scripts/`: Development and deployment utilities
- `config/`: Configuration files

## Branch Structure:
Our project follows a structured branching model to maintain code quality and streamline development:

### Main Branches:
1. `main`: Production-ready code
   - Contains stable, tested releases
   - Only updated by project administrators
   - No direct pull requests allowed

2. `develop`: Integration branch
   - Main development branch
   - Receives features and fixes
   - All developers can contribute

3. `hotfix`: Emergency fixes
   - For critical production issues
   - Merges into both `main` and `develop`
   - Follows naming: `hotfix/issue-description`

4. `fix`: Regular bug fixes
   - For non-critical issues
   - Merges into `develop`
   - Follows naming: `fix/issue-description`

5. `feature`: New features
   - For implementing new functionality
   - Merges into `develop`
   - Follows naming: `feature/feature-name`

### Branch Flow:
```
